# Benro Sponsorship

## Original outreach email (2-Sep-2024)
To support@benro.com,

Thank you for releasing the fantastic Benro Polaris tripod head product. It is the best travel astro mount you can buy worldwide - lightweight, sturdy, high precision, and well-designed.

I have started a community project based on user feedback from the Facebook Polaris Camera Controller Global Group. The project aims to allow a wider suite of astrophotography applications to be compatible with the Bennro Polaris. Please refer to the following link for more information -  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jdmorriso/alpaca-benro-polaris-driver. I aim to release this project on GitHub in October 2024. The project has received extensive encouragement from the Facebook group and is well on track to make its release date.

This email is to check whether Benro's leadership can support the project. I'm not asking for any pledge (although anything would help). More so, I'm asking for Benro Leadership's project acknowledgment and approval. 
From a technical perspective, I would appreciate it if the Benro Design team could consider this community project's compatibility when making future changes to the firmware or application. If we are notified of any protocol changes, we can maintain compatibility, proactively. 

Finally, we would welcome a representative from Benro to join the Design team on GitHub. We welcome any design review, feedback, or contributions to ensure the driver controls the  Benro Polaris as intended.

Based on the enthusiasm from the Kickstart project and Facebook group, this project can grow Benro Polaris sales and user engagement.    

Thank you for your time and support.

Best Regards
David Morrison

## Followup correspondance (16-Sep-2024)
To support@benro.com,
This is a follow-up to my request for support on the Alpaca Benro Polaris Project. 

The project has continued to gain support across the user community and has transitioned into a beta testing phase. It is feature-complete, and the remaining work focuses on QA, performance, and stability. The project will be released as open-source in less than two weeks. 

Please let me know if you have a technical representative to review the work before its release. Also, let me know if you have any requirements or changes you would like to make to the project before it becomes public.

Best Regards
David Morrison

## Final Call for involvement (25-Sep-2024) - No Response
Dear Benro Support,
I want to thank Benro Leadership again for releasing the excellent Benro Polaris Tripod Head. I've been more impressed with its design and quality as I have learned more about its performance and behavior. I also want to thank Benro Leadership for monitoring the Alpaca Benro Polaris Project and not attempting to halt or prevent its release. 

This is the last-chance call for a review of the project before I release it on September 29th, 2024. I am still willing to add access to the GitHub repository for a Benro Technical Representative to review and request changes before the release. If you want to do this, please reply with a GitHub user account name as soon as possible.

Best Regards
David Morrison

Dear Benro Team,

Objective Statement:

Our goal is to collaborate with Benro to resolve these issues and enhance the overall user experience for all Polaris customers.

## Benro Australia (31-Oct-2025) - No Response
Hi Benro Australia, 
I have a Benro Polaris that has two hardware issues.
1. When the battery falls to 1% I cannot get the device to recharge. I've tried every type of USB-C connected powerbank and power supply. Cannot use the device at all while in this state.
2. I have one of the early Benro Polaris devices, as it can be tough to turn on with the double press of the power button. I've followed the Global Facebook Forum comments but it can be very challenging sometimes to even power the device on.
Could you put me in contact with someone from Benro who can support me?

## Benro Support (8-Nov-2025)
Dear Support Team,
Problem: Polaris has become unresponsive and does not power up.

Description: Unable to power Polaris device or connect via the Benro Connect App. The Green LED only illuminates when USB power is supplied. The Blue LED never illuminates. When I attempt to power on the device, I hear the 3 beeps, but no blue LED. It does not appear to be advertising on Bluetooth either as the Connect App cannot see it on the Nearby Devices page. When I hold the Power Button the Polaris Beeps once, moves slightly, but does not proceed to the storage position.

Recovery: I have attempted the following steps to recover the device.
1. Power on device multiple times, double pressing power button as usually successful.
2. Disconnect charging cable and repeat 1.
3. Charged the device overnight with a 5V/2A Power supply.
4. Viewed contents of SD Card. The log file appears fine, except for the last 30 lines which has garbled characters/non-ascii.
5. Copied downloaded firmware and files onto SD Card to attempt firmware restore. Not successful
6. Replace SIM with another card and still no success at power on.

This problem has only started occurring from late last week. 
It was not in use when the problem first occurred. 
The Polaris has HW v1.3.1.4 and SW V6.0.0.54

I suspect that the Polaris will need to be sent for repair. 
Can I get a Service Docket Number and Address to where to send it?
Once asessed, could I get a quote on how much it will cost to get repaired?
Also is there any chance I could get a loan Polaris device while it is being repaired.

Thank you for any assistance to help expedite this case.
