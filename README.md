# Introduction
![Overview](docs/images/abp-overview.png)


Are you interested in trying your hand at amateur astrophotography? Invest in a [Benro Polaris with its Astro Kit](https://www.benro-polaris.com/), and this project will transform it from a great Tripod Head to a full-featured, open Telescope Mount. This project aims to provide users with a way to control their Benro Polaris using more advanced astrophotography software, including [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/en/), [Nina](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/), and other applications that support the ASCOM Alpaca platform. 

# Intended Audience
Just starting in Astrophotography and the Benro Polaris, then check out our [Beginners and Learning Guide](docs/beginners.md) to help learn the basics. The project documentation and features target individuals familiar with astrophotography concepts and software like deep sky astronomy, image sequencing, plate solving, polar alignment, equatorial coordinates, and image stacking. The first release is intended for users comfortable with technical setups involving MacOS or Windows, mini-PCs, Command Windows, and Networks, as these are presented as options for running the Alpaca-Benro-Polaris Driver.

# Project Purpose
The [Benro Polaris](https://www.benro-polaris.com/) tripod head is a great product. It's manufactured to a high standard, comes in a compact and sturdy design, and its mobile App has many easy-to-use features. Although its not cheap, it is cheaper than a modern telescope mount like the [ZWO AM3 Harmonic Equatorial Mount](https://www.zwoastro.com/product/zwo-am3-harmonic-equatorial-mount/). The Polaris can also be used for other photography projects beyond astro-photography.

That is what this project is all about. The intention is to open up the Benro Polaris with an HTTP-based [REST API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis) that will allow other applications to leverage this great platform. 

The Alpaca Benro Polaris (`ABP`) supports a standard [ASCOM](https://ascom-standards.org/) device interface called  [ITelescopeV3 interface](https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Developer/html/T_ASCOM_DeviceInterface_ITelescopeV3.htm) to control the Benro Polaris tripod head. This standard interface supports applications like [Stellarium Desktop](https://stellarium.org/en/) (a free open-source planetarium application) and [Nina](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) (Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy - An astrophotography imaging suite). 

The ABP also supports a subset of the [SynSCAN protocol](https://inter-static.skywatcher.com/downloads/synscanserialcommunicationprotocol_version33.pdf) over the network. This allows the Driver to support mobile applications like [Stellarium Mobile PLUS](https://stellarium-labs.com/stellarium-mobile-plus/) or [Sky Safari 7 Plus and Pro](https://skysafariastronomy.com/).

The priorities of this open-source project reflect feedback from the [Polaris Camera Controller Global Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/326138891873755). This group provided great suggestions and encouragement for this project, with over 120 supporting it in just 2 days. I've summarised the feedback comments below with features getting the most requests listed as high-priority. The open-source project meets ALL feasible requests. There are still some challenges to the 3-point alignment; although we have some ideas!

And finaly, just a brief note about risks....

## Caution - Use at own Risk
Please be aware that this is not official Benro Software. If you decide to use it - you are doing so at your own risk.

There is a chance of voiding the warranty or damaging your Benro Polaris hardware. There is a chance that you may use the driver/hardware in a way, unintended by its design. The driver is not official Benro software. They may not support you. Due to the extensive testing, the risk of hardware damage is very low.

Also note that the ASCOM Alpaca standard is not secure. It is open by design. Simply stated, Alpaca and network security are separate things. Only use within an isolated protected virtual or local network.

Finally, it's important to note that while the Alpaca Benro Polaris Driver unlocks significant potential from the Benro Polaris, it cannot entirely overcome the device's inherent hardware limitations. Users aiming for extended exposures, particularly with longer focal lengths, might still encounter tracking errors despite the driver's enhancements. Therefore, managing your expectations regarding the Polaris's capabilities, especially for deep-sky astrophotography, is crucial.
