The risk is elevated more than v1.0 as the Alpaca Driver will be in direct control of the Benro Polaris during movement. There is a chance that you may use the driver/hardware in a way, unintended by its design. The driver is not official Benro software. They may not support you. </div><div class="q-pa-sm"> Also note that the ASCOM Alpaca standard is not secure. It is open by design. Simply stated, Alpaca and network security are separate things. Only use within an isolated protected virtual or local network. </div><div class="q-pa-sm"> Finally, it&#39;s important to note that while the Alpaca Benro Polaris Driver unlocks significant potential from the Benro Polaris, it cannot entirely overcome the device&#39;s inherent hardware limitations. Users aiming for extended exposures, particularly with longer focal lengths, might still encounter tracking errors despite the driver&#39;s enhancements. Therefore, managing your expectations regarding the Polaris&#39;s capabilities, especially for deep-sky astrophotography, is crucial. </div></div></div>',3)),r(n,{class:"q-mt-xl",color:"primary",unelevated:"",to:"/",label:"Go Home","no-caps":""})])]))}});export{p as default};
